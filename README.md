# Password Generator with Angular

I started to learn Angular and this is my first app.\
I've learned about component template, component class, property and event binding, interpolation and structural directive and tried to use my knowledge in this application and also I learned and used**TypeScript**.\
It's a simple app with simple randomize function for password creating and input validating. I used Bulma for styling and I've deployed it to Vercel.\
Also for commiting and pushing changes to Git, I've used Git Bash and not GitHub Desktop, as I usually did.\
You can try it [here](https://shoshas-password-generator.vercel.app/)
